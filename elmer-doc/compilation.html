[Compilation instructions]


[[Quick start]]

Make sure you have a working blas, lapack and umfpack that work with
your compiler (the configure scripts will tell you if somethings
wrong). Then pick an installation directory, I recommend something
like ~/bin/elmer or ~/elmer. Then compiler the elmer source packages
in the following order: matc, eio, hutiter, elmergrid, meshgen2d,
fem using the normal procedure of ./configure ; make ; make
install. Use ./configure --help for some brief instructions

!gunzip hutiter-x.x.x.tar.gz ; tar xvf hutiter-x.x.x.tar!
!cd hutiter-x.x.x ; ./configure --prefix=~/elmer ; make ; make install!

[[Specifying libraries]]


If you want to specify your own blas and lapack, you can eg.

!./configure --with-blas="~/lib/libblas.a"!

or use the environment variable:

!BLAS_LIBS="-L/some/convoluted/path/lib -lblas3.1.03"!

a similar procedure works for most of the libraries that are detected
using 

[[Testing the build]]

Get the newest elmer-tests package. Run the tests.
