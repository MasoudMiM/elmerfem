Development of Elmer was part of a Finnish national CFD programme
coordinated by the Technology Development Centre of Finland (TEKES)
since 1995. The main objective was to develop a fluid dynamics program,
based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), which could be utilized in
industrial processes where heat transfer in different forms and
incompressible flows are present. </p>

<p>
Elmer was build as a collection of programmes for preprocessing,
solving and postprocessing rather than a single monolithic application,
i.e., each phase of the computational process can be handled separately.
The aim was to develop a flexible tool in a sense that an engineer can
work on a simulation on his own desktop on smaller scale before performing 
the full simulation on an appropriate machine. </p>

<p>
Elmer was originally developed in co-operation between 
<ul>
<li> CSC - Scientific Computing Ltd.</li>
<li> Helsinki University of Technology</li>
<li> Okmetic Ltd.</li>
<li> Technical Research Centre of Finland</li>
<li> University of Jyväskylä</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Previous research on mesh generation, FEM methodology and FEM applications
to flow problems, direct and iterative solvers and parallel computing in
these institutes was utilized in the work.</p>
