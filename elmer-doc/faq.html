<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p><div class="question">Q:</div> I can't get elmer to compile, I've
tried specifying compilers and libraries by hand to the correct ones
with no avail.</p>
<p><div class="answer">A:</div> If the platform and compiler is not
listed in the "known to compile" section, then there is a big
chance that the code won't compile. You can of course ask for help,
but we won't guarantee anything :)</p>

<p><div class="question">Q:</div> Is there any way to disable cross
dependencies for the fortran files in the fem module?</p>
<p><div class="answer">A:</div> Yes there is. Go to subdirectory
fem/src and type <code>make nofdeps</code>. If you need to re-enable
the dependencies type <code>make fdeps</code>.</p>

<p><div class="question">Q:</div> Why are so many files compiled even
though I have only made a small modification to the source in the fem module?</p>
<p><div class="answer">A:</div> The fortran dependencies are needed
for compiling the package the first time (so that files are compiled
in correct order). After this, the modifications are often so small
that you would actually just need to compile only modified files (if
there are no major structural changes), you can achieve this by
removing dependencies, see previous answer.</p>

<p><div class="question">Q:</div> I'm getting weird compilation errors
when compiling with multiple threads eg. <code>make -j42</code>.</p>
<p><div class="answer">A:</div> There are many causes for weird
errors, but possibly the most common one is related with NFS not being
able to handle the traffic amount generated by massively parallel
compilation. Try using a mount point that isn't a networked file
system or reduce the number of processes.</p>
