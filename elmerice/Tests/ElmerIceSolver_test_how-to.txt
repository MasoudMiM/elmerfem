ElmerIce Solver test case "How-to"
==================================

This How-to describes how to create and use test cases in software
development and case definition.

The test cases are used to check for possible bugs, and to ensure 
backward compability. For that purpose they are currently around 
30 repertories (Dec 2013) . The tests should be located in directory

fem/elmerice/tests

The results are compared with the version 6441 on
 LGGE's cluster [proc  Intel Xeon, 4 cores/CPUs ].

To run the cases in Unix you can go the the directory tests, update
script with command line:

chmod u+x runTest.sh
runTest.sh (with options or not)

A. Options
===========
See details for the 4 options and one default option ( "", --help , --all,
--selection, --solvers).

1) --all or -a
it runs all tests, and there is possibility to send results by e-mail.

2) --selection or -s
it runs only selection of repertory with "space-separator", and there is 
possibility to send results by e-mail.

3) --solvers or -so
You choose one ElmerIceSolver keyword and it runs all repertories with this 
solver, and there is possibility to send results by e-mail.

4) Default case: all test cases without mail option.

B. How to create a test
========================

When a new feature has been verified it is often a good idea to
create a test case that ensures the feature will be 
maintained also in the future versions of Elmer. To do this:

1) Create new directory in the "tests" directory under fem/elmerice. The folders
   in this directory will be automatically scanned and tests run.

2) Define your analysis write your .sif file, mesh files
   etc. necessary to run the test analysis ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO

   ******
   !   Note, for the outputs, files named "results.dat" and "result.dat.names" have to be created
   !   If do not exist, you can write a script to configure their creation
   !   see /tests/InvMeth_AdjBeta for example).
   ******

3) Define how to run the test write a Makefile (named Makefile), that
   details two targets:
	+ run: how to run the test
	+ clean: how to clean up if successfull

4) Define expected results and create repertory /DATA in wich will be put expected 
   results in a file named "valid_$NameRepertory.txt" (See description in the template above:

	Step1Data1 [space] Step1Data2 [space] Step1Data3 ....
	Step2Data1 [space] Step2Data2 [space] Step2Data3 ....

5 ) If you have access right to the svn you may also

       svn add mytestcase
       svn commit mytestcase


D. Results 
=====================
	On screen
	---------
Test will print some informations for each test-case:
<Test Number>		<Test Name>		[<Result>]
In <Result>, [FAILED] in case where difference between results are upper 1E-8
	     [PASSED] in case where there is no difference
	     [PASSED - Diff Time-] where there is a difference with time CPU

	In repertory File_log/
	----------------------
We will found 2 files per test if there is difference between results: 
one is resume of your simulation and the other resume differences.


E. How to use the test case as starting point
==============================================

One can take these tests as a starting point or copy-paste
appropriate solver sections from there. These tests do not include
any ElmerGUI project file and therefore the graphical user interface
cannot be used to view these cases. You can look at the Makefile in
each test to see what sequence of command is usually needed. Typically
some simple ascii definition for the mesh is used and the running of
the case could be something like

ElmerGrid 1 2 square
ElmerSolver mytest.sif
