Test Case for the inversion of the basal slip coefficient 
using the control inverse method.

The setup is based on Mac Ayeal, D.,"A tutorial on the use of control methods in ice-sheet modeling",  J. Glaciol., 39(131), 1993

Synthetic data (for U and V surface velocity, bedrock elevation and surface elevation) used as "perfect" observations are stored under the Data directory and have been generated previously using a slip coefficient defined by
$ function betaSquare(tx) {\
  Lx = 200.0e3;\
  Ly = 50.0e03;\
  yearinsec = 365.25*24*60*60;\
  F1=sin(3.0*pi*tx(0)/Lx)*sin(pi*tx(1)/Ly);\
  F2=sin(pi*tx(0)/(2.0*Lx))*cos(4.0*pi*tx(1)/Ly);\
  beta=5.0e3*F1+5.0e03*F2;\
  _betaSquare=beta*beta/(1.0e06*yearinsec);\
}
