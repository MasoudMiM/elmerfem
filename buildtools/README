These are external scripts that are used for building ELMER. The main
purpose is to test the source on different platforms in an automated
way. As a side product, binaries and source tarballs are produced. 

Important scripts:

compile.sh     # Pull elmer from CVS and compile everything. Create
	       # source packages.
	       #
	       # Influental env variables:
	       # ELMER_USER      
	       # ELMER_CVSROOT
	       # NPROCS
	       # ELMER_MODULES
	       # ELMER_CHECK

testpkgs.sh    # Test that elmer compiles from source packages. (all
	       # have to be under pwd)

*.sh	       # Set platform specific environment variables and call
	       # compile.sh

Release check list:

compile.sh:
- See that it builds on all platforms
- Tests are passed
- Create binary distro
- Create paranoid binary distro
  - copy libs that ldd points to
- Test relocated binary distro

testpkgs.sh:
- Test that packages also work
