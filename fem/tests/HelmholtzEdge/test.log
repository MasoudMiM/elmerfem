Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
1 cells were created.
Numbered 1089 knots in 1024 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 35.
Maximum elementsize is 3.125e-02 and minimum 3.125e-02.
32 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
32 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
32 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 3.
32 element sides between materials 5 and 1 were located to type 4.
The mesh was reconstructed from 2048 triangles
Setting element of material 1 to have advanced settings [0 1 0 0 0]
Creating advanced elements finished

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory square.
Saving 1089 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 2048 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
