Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
3 cells were created.
Numbered 560 knots in 507 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 29.
Maximum elementsize is 7.692e-02 and minimum 7.692e-02.
26 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
39 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
13 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 3.
26 element sides between materials 5 and 1 were located to type 4.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory test.
Saving 560 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 507 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
