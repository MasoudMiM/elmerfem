Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
1 cells were created.
Numbered 567 knots in 120 9-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 164.
Maximum elementsize is 2.500e-02 and minimum 1.502e-02.
3 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
3 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory geomstiff.
Saving 567 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 120 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
