Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
6 cells were created.
Numbered 240 knots in 204 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 11.
Maximum elementsize is 1.836e+00 and minimum 8.333e-02.
4 element sides between materials 7 and 1 were located to type 1.
3 element sides between materials 6 and 1 were located to type 2.
4 element sides between materials 6 and 2 were located to type 3.
24 element sides between materials 4 and 2 were located to type 4.
27 element sides between materials 5 and 1 were located to type 5.
4 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 6.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory Step_ke.
Saving 240 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 204 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
