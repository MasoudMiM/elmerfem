Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
3 cells were created.
Numbered 1632 knots in 511 8-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 67.
Maximum elementsize is 1.471e-02 and minimum 7.143e-03.
14 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
21 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
63 element sides between materials 0 and 1 were located to type 3.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory Step.
Saving 1632 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 511 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
