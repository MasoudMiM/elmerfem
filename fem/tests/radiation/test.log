Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
12 cells were created.
Numbered 148 knots in 105 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 15.
Maximum elementsize is 1.000e-01 and minimum 6.250e-02.
14 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 1.
25 element sides between materials 3 and 2 were located to type 2.
37 element sides between materials 0 and 2 were located to type 3.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory radiation.
Saving 148 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 105 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
