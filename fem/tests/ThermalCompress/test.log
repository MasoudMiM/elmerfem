Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
1 cells were created.
Numbered 441 knots in 400 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 23.
Maximum elementsize is 5.000e-02 and minimum 5.000e-02.
20 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
20 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
20 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 3.
20 element sides between materials 5 and 1 were located to type 4.

Elmergrid saving data:
