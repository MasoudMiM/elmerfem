Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
7 cells were created.
Numbered 1143 knots in 1001 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 74.
Maximum elementsize is 1.429e-01 and minimum 1.250e-01.
8 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 1.
7 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 2.
267 element sides between materials 0 and -10 were located to type 3.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory Pipe.
Saving 1143 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 1001 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
