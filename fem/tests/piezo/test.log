Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
2 cells were created.
Numbered 369 knots in 320 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 11.
Maximum elementsize is 2.500e-02 and minimum 2.500e-02.
4 element sides between materials -4 and 1 were located to type 1.
4 element sides between materials -4 and 2 were located to type 2.
40 element sides between materials -1 and 2 were located to type 3.
40 element sides between materials -3 and 1 were located to type 4.
4 element sides between materials -2 and 1 were located to type 5.
4 element sides between materials -2 and 2 were located to type 6.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory beam.
Saving 369 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 320 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
