Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
7 cells were created.
Numbered 670 knots in 576 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 51.
Maximum elementsize is 2.277e-04 and minimum 5.000e-05.
1 element sides between materials -4 and 1 were located to type 1.
2 element sides between materials -4 and 2 were located to type 2.
Created 8 extruded divisions.
Elementtype 404 extruded to type 808.
Extruded mesh has 4272 elements in 8 levels.
Extruded BC 0 of type 1 was created with 2 sides.
Extruded BC 1 of type 2 was created with 8 sides.
BC 2 on layer 1 was created with 504 sides.
BC 3 on layer 3 was created with 72 sides.
There were more than one topology in the BC definition
BC 4 on layer 5 was created with 24 sides.
BC 5 on layer 7 was created with 48 sides.
BC 6 on layer 9 was created with 504 sides.
6030 original nodes moved to 5454 new ones.
Reordering 5454 knots and 4272 elements in 3-dimensions.
Ordering with (1e+04*x + 100*y + 1*z)
Moving knots to new positions
Moving the elements to new positions
Moving the parents of the boundary nodes.
Indexwidth of the new node order is 208.
Created 4272 elements and 5454 nodes by extruding the 2D geometry

Elmergrid saving data:
