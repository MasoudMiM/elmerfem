Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
3 cells were created.
Numbered 496 knots in 430 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 13.
Maximum elementsize is 3.956e-01 and minimum 1.667e-01.
116 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
10 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
4 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 3.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory step.
Saving 496 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 430 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
