Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
1 cells were created.
Numbered 549 knots in 120 9-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 20.
Maximum elementsize is 3.333e-02 and minimum 2.083e-02.
4 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
30 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
30 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 3.
4 element sides between materials 5 and 1 were located to type 4.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory elasticity.
Saving 549 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 120 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
