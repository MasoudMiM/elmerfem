! Solver two ordinary & Poisson equations of the same kind
!
! We assume eq. -\nabla^2 f = 1 and -\nabla^2 g = -1 .
! Then make a change of variables u=f-cg and v=g+cf and
! solve for u and v with given c. The result of 
! f=(u+cg)/(1+c*c) and g=(v-cf)/(1+c*c) does not depend on c but the 
! difficulty of iteration does. Simple block schemes are stable
! only for morerate values of c (|c| < 0.5).
