Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
3 cells were created.
Numbered 595 knots in 531 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 16.
Maximum elementsize is 4.978e-01 and minimum 1.395e-01.
6 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
13 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
107 element sides between materials 0 and 1 were located to type 3.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory Step.
Saving 595 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 531 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
