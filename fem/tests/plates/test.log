The mesh is devided into 3 separate subcells.
Created 39 radial and 40 axial divisions, total of 300 elements.

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
3 cells were created.
Numbered 341 knots in 300 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 23.
Maximum elementsize is 1.000e-01 and minimum 1.000e-01.
80 element sides between materials 0 and 1 were located to type 1.
The mesh was reconstructed from 600 triangles

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory plates.
Saving 341 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 600 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
