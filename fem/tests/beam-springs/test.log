Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
1 cells were created.
Numbered 36 knots in 25 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 8.
Maximum elementsize is 2.000e-01 and minimum 2.000e-01.
5 element sides between materials -1 and 1 were located to type 1.
5 element sides between materials -2 and 1 were located to type 2.
5 element sides between materials -3 and 1 were located to type 3.
5 element sides between materials -4 and 1 were located to type 4.
Created 41 extruded divisions.
Elementtype 404 extruded to type 808.
Extruded mesh has 1025 elements in 41 levels.
Extruded BC 0 of type 1 was created with 205 sides.
Extruded BC 1 of type 2 was created with 205 sides.
Extruded BC 2 of type 3 was created with 205 sides.
Extruded BC 3 of type 4 was created with 205 sides.
BC 4 on layer 1 was created with 25 sides.
BC 5 on layer 42 was created with 25 sides.
Reordering 1512 knots and 1025 elements in 3-dimensions.
Ordering with (1*x + 1*y + 1e+04*z)
Moving knots to new positions
Moving the elements to new positions
Moving the parents of the boundary nodes.
Indexwidth of the new node order is 51.
Created 1025 elements and 1512 nodes by extruding the 2D geometry

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory beam3d.
Reusing an existing directory
Saving 1512 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 1025 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
