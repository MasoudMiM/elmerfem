Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
8 cells were created.
Numbered 576 knots in 512 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 27.
Maximum elementsize is 1.250e-01 and minimum 1.250e-01.
32 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
96 element sides between materials 0 and 1 were located to type 2.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory heater.
Saving 576 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 512 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
