Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
1 cells were created.
Numbered 56 knots in 42 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 9.
Maximum elementsize is 1.667e-01 and minimum 1.429e-01.
6 element sides between materials -1 and 1 were located to type 1.
7 element sides between materials -2 and 1 were located to type 2.
6 element sides between materials -3 and 1 were located to type 3.
7 element sides between materials -4 and 1 were located to type 4.
Created 61 extruded divisions.
Elementtype 404 extruded to type 808.
Extruded mesh has 2562 elements in 61 levels.
Extruded BC 0 of type 1 was created with 366 sides.
Extruded BC 1 of type 2 was created with 427 sides.
Extruded BC 2 of type 3 was created with 366 sides.
Extruded BC 3 of type 4 was created with 427 sides.
BC 4 on layer 1 was created with 42 sides.
BC 5 on layer 62 was created with 42 sides.
Reordering 3472 knots and 2562 elements in 3-dimensions.
Ordering with (1*x + 1*y + 1e+04*z)
Moving knots to new positions
Moving the elements to new positions
Moving the parents of the boundary nodes.
Indexwidth of the new node order is 70.
Created 2562 elements and 3472 nodes by extruding the 2D geometry

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory beam3d.
Saving 3472 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 2562 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
