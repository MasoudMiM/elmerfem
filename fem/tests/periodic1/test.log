Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
1 cells were created.
Numbered 552 knots in 506 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <y><x> and max levelwidth 26.
Maximum elementsize is 4.545e-02 and minimum 4.348e-02.
22 element sides between materials 2 and 1 were located to type 1.
22 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 2.
23 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 3.
23 element sides between materials 5 and 1 were located to type 4.

Elmergrid saving data:
