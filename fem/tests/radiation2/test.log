Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
8 cells were created.
Numbered 265 knots in 208 4-node elements.
Numbering order was <x><y> and max levelwidth 15.
Maximum elementsize is 6.250e-02 and minimum 6.250e-02.
16 element sides between materials 3 and 1 were located to type 1.
8 element sides between materials 3 and 2 were located to type 1.
16 element sides between materials 4 and 1 were located to type 2.
8 element sides between materials 4 and 2 were located to type 2.
52 element sides between materials 0 and 1 were located to type 3.

Elmergrid saving data:
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory radiation2.
Saving 265 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 208 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
