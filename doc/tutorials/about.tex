\chapter*{About Elmer Tutorials}

The Elmer Tutorials is part of the documentation of 
Elmer finite element software.
Elmer Tutorials gives examples on the use of Elmer in different field
of continuum physics. Also coupled problems are included. 

The intended audience for the manuals of the Elmer software 
are engineers and
scientists in universities, research institutes and industry. The documents
aim at offering a sufficiently accurate and detailed description of 
the models. The users are expected to have a 
basic knowledge on mathematical modeling and numerical methods. 
Also the user should hopefully understand the structure of the command file.
The Elmer Models Manual is best used as a reference manual 
rather than a concise introduction to the matter. 

The present Elmer Tutorials 
corresponds to Elmer software version \elmerversion{} for 
Windows NT and Unix platforms. 

Elmer Tutorials is delivered via the World Wide Web.
Latest documentations and program versions of Elmer are available at
