\chapter*{About ElmerSolver Manual}

The ElmerSolver Manual is part of the documentation of 
Elmer finite element software.
ElmerSolver Manual describes the Elmer Solver options common for
all specific equation solvers. The different equations solver options
are described separately in Elmer Models Manual.

The intended audience for the manuals of the Elmer software 
are engineers and
scientists in universities, research institutes and industry. The documents
aim at offering a sufficiently accurate and detailed description of 
the models. The users are expected to have a 
basic knowledge on mathematical modeling and numerical methods. 
Also the user should hopefully understand the structure of the command file.
The ElmerSolver Manual is best used as a reference manual 
rather than a concise introduction to the matter. 

The present ElmerSolver Manual
corresponds to Elmer software version \elmerversion{} for 
Windows NT and Unix platforms. 

Elmer Models Manual is delivered via the World Wide Web.
Latest documentations and program versions of Elmer are available at
