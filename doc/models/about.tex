\chapter*{About Elmer Models Manual}

The Elmer Models Manual is part of the documentation of 
Elmer finite element software.
Elmer Models Manual is a selection of independent 
chapters describing different modules of the ElmerSolver. 
The reason for the modular structure of the manual 
is the fact that also
the structure of the software is modular. This
means for example that new models may be written
without any changes in the main program.  
Each solver has a separate section for theory and 
keywords, and often also some additional information 
is given, for example on the limitations of the model.

The intended audience for the manuals of the Elmer software 
are engineers and
scientists in universities, research institutes and industry. The documents
aim at offering a sufficiently accurate and detailed description of 
the models. The users are expected to have a 
basic knowledge on mathematical modeling and numerical methods. 
Also the user should hopefully understand the structure of the command file.
The Elmer Models Manual is best used as a reference manual 
rather than a concise introduction to the matter. 

The present ElmerGrid Manual
corresponds to Elmer software version \elmerversion{} for 
Windows NT and Unix platforms. 

Elmer Models Manual is delivered via the World Wide Web.
Latest documentations and program versions of Elmer are available at
