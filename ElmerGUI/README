Brief build instructions for ElmerGUI:
--------------------------------------

Prequisites:

   - Qt 4                        (tested with 4.2.2 and newer)
   - libng                       (see ./netgen/README)
   - matc                        (part of Elmer, see ./matc/README)

Optional components:

   - Qwt 5                       (for qt 4)
   - Vtk 5                       (compiled with qt 4)
   - Open Cascade                (6.3)
   . PythonQt                    /seet ./PythonQt/README for more details)
   - Tetgen                      (1.4.2 or newer)

Please read the file LICENSES before using any of these software components.

Tetgen should be installed as described in ../misc/tetgen_patches/REAEDME

In order to compile ElmerGUI, edit the file ElmerGUI.pro and select the
optional components to include. Also edit the file ElmerGUI.pri to define
the directories where the external libraries and their headers reside.

If this is the first time you compile ElmerGUI, the following lines may be
commented out in order to minimize possible compilation problems (add the
lines gradually back later):

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional components:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEFINES += QWT       # Use QWT for convergence monitor?
# DEFINES += VTKPOST   # Use VTK for postprocessing?
# DEFINES += MATC      # Use MATC for internal operations in postprocessing?
# DEFINES += OCC_63    # Use OpenCASCADE 6.3 for importing CAD files?

Then type:

$ qmake
$ make

This should produce the executable "./ElmerGUI" or "./release/ElmerGUI.exe"

If the plugin for tetgen is found in the path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Unix,
and PATH for Windows), its functionality will be available when
the program starts. If the lib is not found, the main program will run,
but with some functionality disabled.

Finally install the program by typing

$ make install

Finally set the environment variable ELMERGUI_HOME = $ELMER_HOME/bin to
point to the installation directory (ELMER_HOME is defined in ElmerGUI.pri).
