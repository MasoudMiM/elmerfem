Brief build instructions for ElmerGUI:
--------------------------------------

Prequisites:

   - Qt 4                        (tested with 4.2.2 and newer)
   - libng                       (see ./netgen/README)
   - Matc                        (part of Elmer, see ./matc/README)

Optional components:

   - Qwt 5                       (for qt 4)
   - Vtk 5                       (compiled with qt 4)
   - Open Cascade                (6.3)
   - Tetgen                      (1.4.2 or newer)

Please read the file LICENSES before using any of these software components.

Tetgen should be installed as described in ../misc/tetgen_patches/REAEDME

In order to compile ElmerGUI, edit the file ElmerGUI.pro to select the
optional components, and define the directories where the external libraries
reside.

If this is the first time you compile ElmerGUI, the following lines may be
commented out in order to minimize possible compilation problems (add the
lines gradually back later):

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional components:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEFINES += QWT       # Use QWT for convergence monitor?
# DEFINES += VTKPOST   # Use VTK for postprocessing?
# DEFINES += MATC      # Use MATC for internal operations in postprocessing?
# DEFINES += OCC_63    # Use OpenCASCADE 6.3 for importing CAD files?

Then type:

$ qmake
$ make

This should produce the executable "./ElmerGUI" or "./release/ElmerGUI.exe"

If the plugin for tetgen is found in the path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Unix,
and PATH for Windows), its functionality will be available when
the program starts. If the lib is not found, the main program will run,
but with some functionality disabled.

Finally:

- set the environment variable ELMERGUI_HOME point to the directory
  containing the executable
- copy the directory "edf" and its contents in ELMERGUI_HOME

NOTE ON WIN32 / VC:
-------------------
If you are using VTK for postprocessing, and MATC for manipulating internal
variables, matc.lib should be built locally prior to compiling ElmerGUI:

cd matc
nmake
