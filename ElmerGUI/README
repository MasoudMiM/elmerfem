Brief build instructions for ElmerGUI:
--------------------------------------

Prequisites:

   - Qt 4                        (tested with 4.2.2 and newer)

Optional components:

   - Qwt 5                       (for qt 4)
   - Vtk 5                       (compiled with qt 4)
   - Matc                        (part of elmer)
   - Tetgen                      (1.4.2 or newer)
   - Netgen                      (4.5 or newer)
   - Open Cascade                (6.2)

Please read the file LICENSES before using any of these software components.

Tetlib should be installed as described in ../misc/tetgen_patches/REAEDME
Nglib should be installed as described in ../misc/netgen_patches/README

In order to compile ElmerGUI, edit the file ElmerGUI.pro to select the
optional components, and define the location of the external libraries.

If this is the first time you compile ElmerGUI, it is recommended to
comment out the following lines, and add them gradually later:

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional components:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEFINES += QWT       # Use QWT for convergence monitor?
# DEFINES += VTKPOST   # Use VTK for postprocessing?
# DEFINES += MATC      # Use MATC for internal operations in postprocessing?

Then type:

$ qmake
$ make

If you want to specify a platform dependendent project file, type:

$ qmake ElmerGUI_macosx.pro
$ make 

This should produce the executable "./ElmerGUI" or "./release/ElmerGUI.exe"

If the above does not work, it is possible that you have to edit the project
file more carefully and ajust the following lines according to your Qwt, Vtk,
and Matc installations:

      INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/qwt-qt4
      LIBS += -lqwt-qt4

      INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/vtk-5.0
      LIBS += -lvtkHybrid -lQVTK

      LIBPATH += /usr/local/lib
      LIBS += -lmatc

Note that libqtw5 may have different names on different platforms.

If the libs of tetgen and netgen are found in the path, their functionality
will be available to the program at start up. If the libs are not found, the
program will run, but with some functionality disabled.

Finally:

- set the environment variable ELMERGUI_HOME point to the directory
  containing the executable
- copy the directory "edf" and its contents in ELMERGUI_HOME
