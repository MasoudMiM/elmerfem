The package netgen.tar.gz in this directory (if present) is a CVS checkout 
of netgen's repository at 27. Feb 2008. It contains the files needed to build
nglib for Mesh3D/ElmerGUI (for license, see netgen/LGPL).

If the package is not present, you can obtain the relevant files by performing
an CVS checkout from Netgen's repository. Follow the instructions on netgen's
we site:

     http://www.hpfem.jku.at/netgen/

In order to build a shared object of nglib for Mesh3D, you will have to:

- unzip the package: tar xvfz netgen.tar.gz (or do the CVS checkout)
- Copy the file COofMP.cpp in netgen/ngcore
- Copy the file makedll.sh in netgen/ngcore (Windows only)
- Copy the file compile_linux.sh in netgen/ngcore (Linux only)
- Copy the file testmain.cpp in netgen/ngcore (Windows only)
- Edit the file netgen/libsrc/interface/nglib.h by adding the following line
  right after the typedefs and enums (around line 44)

  extern "C" {

  Then, in the end of the file, right before the last #endif, add:

  }

- cd to netgen/ngcore and run the script "makedll.sh" (Windows) or 
  "compile_linux.sh" (Linux)

- test the lib as (Windows only):

 g++ -DWIN32 testmain.cpp -o testmain.exe
 ./testmain cube.surf

- copy "ngcore/libng.dll" (Windows) or "ngcore/libng.so" (Linux) in Mesh3D's
  main directory. Also copy "libsrc/interface/nglib.h" (Windows and Linux).
