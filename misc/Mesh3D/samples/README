Terms of use of the INRIA Gamma team research database Website Collections

All the models contained in this database have been developed or downloaded on the web by the INRIA Gamma researcher's team.

This database has been created for research purposes, and is used by the Gamma team and its partners.

These meshes must only be used for personal and non commercial uses unless widest rights are granted on the origin website. To be more precise, they must not be distributed for any reasons and by any methods (unless widest rights are granted on the origin website).

At the beginning, our idea was not to constitute a public research database. But considering the scientific interest of this database, we decided to display it publicly. To conduct this project and be as much respectful as possible of the authors rights, we intended to identify all of them and websites. Unfortunately we downloaded most of the files a long time ago and we couldn't retrieve all of the websites they come from.

So, in case you identify a model you created in this database, please feel free to contact us with all the information related to the file and we would be happy to add the information.

Anyway, unknown origin files must only be used for personal and non commercial uses and must not be redistributed. The download of any file does not entitle you to claim for its paternity.

The access conditions are also given if there are known.
