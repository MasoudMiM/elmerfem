Build instructions:
-------------------

Prequisites:

   - qt 4                        (tested with 4.2.2 and newer)
   - qwt 5                       (for qt 4)

Optional components:

   - tetlib 1.4.2 (or newer)
   - nglib 4.5 (or newer)

Tetlib should be installed as described in ../tetgen_patches/REAEDME
Nglib should be installed as described in ../netgen_patches/README

Please read the file LICENSES before using any of these software components.

To begin with, create a qt 4 project file for Mesh3D:

   $ qmake -project

At this point, you may need to edit the file "Mesh3D.pro" and add the
following lines somewhere in the file:

   INCLUDEPATH += /path/to/qwt5/headers
   LIBS += -L/path/to/qwt5/lib -lqwt5

Note that libqtw5 may have a different name on different machines.

You may also need to add:

   QT += opengl xml script

If you are using Windows, you should also add:

   RC_FILE += Mesh3D.rc   

Finally, type:

   $ qmake
   $ make

This should produce the executable "./Mesh3D" or "./release/Mesh3D.exe". If the libs of tetgen and netgen are found in the path, their functionality will be available to the program. If the libs are not found, the program will run, but with some functionality disabled.

Note:

If you have OpenCascade 6.2 installed on your system, it is possible to link EmlerGUI against OCC62 and import brep and step file formats. You should then add -DOCC62 in the command line of the compiler, and link the executable against TKernel, TKMath, TKBRep, TKSTL, TKStdSchema, TKSTEP, TKXSBase. If OCC62 remains undefined, the pre-processor will filter out all OCC62-related lines.
