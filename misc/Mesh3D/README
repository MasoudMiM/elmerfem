Build instructions:
-------------------

Prequisites:

   - qt 4.3.3 (or newer)

Optional components:

   - tetlib 1.4.2 (or newer)
   - nglib 4.5 (or newer)

Tetlib should be installed as described in ../tetgen_patches/REAEDME
Nglib should be installed as described in ../netgen_patches/README

Please read the file LICENSES before using any of these software packages.

Build as follows:

   $ qmake -project

Edit "Mesh3D.pro" and add the following lines somewhere in the file:

   QT += opengl

Finally:

   $ qmake
   $ make

This should produce the executable "./release/Mesh3D". If the libs of tetgen and netgen are found in the path, their functionality will be available to the main program. If the libs are not found, the main program will run, but with some functionality disabled.
