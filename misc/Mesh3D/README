Build instructions:
-------------------

Prequisites:

   - qt 4                        (tested with 4.2.2 and newer)

Optional components:

   - tetlib 1.4.2 (or newer)
   - nglib 4.5 (or newer)

Tetlib should be installed as described in ../tetgen_patches/REAEDME
Nglib should be installed as described in ../netgen_patches/README

Please read the file LICENSES before using any of these software packages.

   $ qmake -project

At this point, you may need to edit the file "Mesh3D.pro" and add the
following line somewhere in the file:

   QT += opengl

If you are using Windows, you should also add:

   RC_FILE += Mesh3D.rc   

Finally:

   $ qmake
   $ make

This should produce the executable "./release/Mesh3D". If the libs of tetgen and netgen are found in the path, their functionality will be available to the main program. If the libs are not found, the main program will run, but with some functionality disabled.
